Integration with dask
=====================

When loading a cube with the :class:`~spectral_cube.SpectralCube` class, it is possible to optionally
specify the ``use_dask`` keyword argument to control whether or not to use new experimental classes
(:class:`~spectral_cube.DaskSpectralCube` and :class:`~spectral_cube.DaskVaryingResolutionSpectralCube`)
that use `dask <https://dask.org/>`_ for representing cubes and carrying out computations efficiently. The default is
``use_dask=True`` when reading in CASA spectral cubes, but not when loading cubes from other formats.

To read in a FITS cube using the dask-enabled classes, you can do::

    >>> from astropy.utils import data
    >>> from spectral_cube import SpectralCube
    >>> fn = data.get_pkg_data_filename('tests/data/example_cube.fits', 'spectral_cube')
    >>> cube = SpectralCube.read(fn, use_dask=True)
    >>> cube
    DaskSpectralCube with shape=(7, 4, 3) and unit=Jy / beam:
     n_x:      3  type_x: RA---ARC  unit_x: deg    range:    52.231466 deg:   52.231544 deg
     n_y:      4  type_y: DEC--ARC  unit_y: deg    range:    31.243639 deg:   31.243739 deg
     n_s:      7  type_s: VRAD      unit_s: m / s  range:    14322.821 m / s:   14944.909 m / s

Most of the properties and methods that normally work with :class:`~spectral_cube.SpectralCube`
should continue to work with :class:`~spectral_cube.DaskSpectralCube`.

By default, we use the ``'synchronous'`` `dask scheduler <https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/scheduler-overview.html>`_
which means that calculations are run in a single process/thread. However, you can control this using the
:meth:`~spectral_cube.DaskSpectralCube.use_dask_scheduler` method:

    >>> cube.use_dask_scheduler('threads')  # doctest: +IGNORE_OUTPUT

Any calculation after this will then use the multi-threaded scheduler. It is also possible to use this
as a context manager, to temporarily change the scheduler::

    >>> with cube.use_dask_scheduler('threads'):  # doctest: +IGNORE_OUTPUT
    ...     cube.max()

If you want to see a progress bar when carrying out calculations, you can make use of the
`dask.diagnostics <https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/diagnostics-local.html>`_ sub-package - run
the following at the start of your script/session, and all subsequent calculations will display
a progress bar:

    >>> from dask.diagnostics import ProgressBar
    >>> pbar = ProgressBar()
    >>> pbar.register()
    >>> cube.max()  # doctest: +IGNORE_OUTPUT
